/**
 * Contains rules & strategies for the most difficult AI agent
 * 
 * The basic strategy of the AgentAggressive is to play the Queen of Spades
 * or a Heart on a user if possible, otherwise determine the best card to play
 * by finding the highest card in the smallest suit that is under the current
 * risk threshold.  This is done leveraging the RiskThreshold class, which
 * contains multiple Thresholds for risk under various situations, which each
 * get adjusted based on the result of what happened each hand.
 * 
 * At a simple level, the risk being compared to the risk threshold is a
 * calculation of the probability that one of the players yet to play does not
 * have any cards in the suit led and that this player also has hearts, and 
 * the probability that if this card is played, that this card would win the
 * hand.  If this value exceeds the risk threshold, it is determined that this
 * card is too risky to play.  If it is under the risk threshold, the card is
 * fine to play.
 * 
 * After each turn is done, look at the cards played in that turn.  If my card
 * won the trick, determine if I took any points, and if so, decrease the risk
 * threshold.  If my card won and I did not win any points, increase the risk
 * threshold.  If my card did not win the trick, increase the risk threshold.
