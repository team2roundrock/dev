/**
 * Class is designed to house risk thresholds and to track and
 * store them for use between sessions.  The RiskThreshold class actually
 * contains six different Threshold objects that are used for comparisons in
 * various sitations:
 * <li>First person playing and Queen Of Spades not played
 * <li>Second person playing and Queen of Spades not played
 * <li>Third person playing and Queen of Spades not played
 * <li>First person playing and Queen of Spades has been played
 * <li>Second person playing and Queen of Spades has been played
 * <li>Third person playing and Queen of Spades has been played
 * 
 * Internally, each Threshold is a double value between 0 and 10.  This value
 * is converted to a value between 0 and 1 using the logistic function (1/(1+e^x))
 * 
 * In this case, because we are using values between 0 and 10, it is actually
 * 1/1+e^(5-x)

	 * So working backwards, internally we are leveraging the logistic function
	 * to get a value between 0 and 1, which is divided by 100 to get a value
	 * between 0 and .01.  The closer the current threshold is to 0, the closer
	 * this value will be to 0, the closer it is to 10, the closer this will
	 * be to .01.  This value from 0 to .01 will be subtracted from 1 to
	 * yield a value between .99 and 1.  This value will then be taken to
	 * the power of however many points were won.  So in the worst case, if
	 * the current threshold had the maximum value of 10, it would net a value
	 * of .99 for the Math.pow.  The most points you could win in a single 
	 * hand is 16, so .99 would be taken to that, which yields the worst case
	 * scenario of approximately .8775 up to the maximum value of 1.  This
	 * value is multiplied by the current threshold, and the threshold is
	 * set to that value.
	 * If there were no points won, this method will actually do an increase
	 * threshold at half of the normal rate that a typical increase would be.
	 * Meaning that it won when it was risky, but it didn't hurt us, so increase
	 * the risk, but by only half as much as you would if you hadn't won with
	 * that card.
